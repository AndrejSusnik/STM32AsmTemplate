# 8by8snake template

This repository provides a template assembly project containing everything needed to follow my [bare metal snake game tutorial](https://zrezke.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/02/23/8by8-snake.html).  Apart from register addresses and such, it also contains a `launch.json` file for debugging in vscode with the cortex-debug extension.  

This template is basically a modified version of [stm32f4 assembly template](https://github.com/fcayci/stm32f4-assembly) by [fcayci](https://github.com/fcayci).
